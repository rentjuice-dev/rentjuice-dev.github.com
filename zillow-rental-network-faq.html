	<h1 class="condenced-bold">What is the Zillow Rental Network?</h1>
	<p class="light">
		The Zillow Rental Network (ZRN) is a free association of property managers and landlords who want to make filling vacancies easier.  In May, Zillow joined forces with technology provider RentJuice to form the ZRN as a way to convert the 6+ millions of renters coming to Zillow everyday into tenants.  By combining the wide reach of Zillow.com with the easy-to-use leasing tools of RentJuice, members of the ZRN ensure that a steady flow of the right candidates are walking through their doors.
