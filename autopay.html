	<h1>Automatic Payment Authorization</h1>
	<p>Last Updated: March 8, 2009</p> 
	<h3>1. E-SIGN CONSENT</h3> 
	<p>This notice contains important information regarding your transaction of business with RentJuice Corporation (“We,” “Us,” “Our,” or “RentJuice”) electronically. Federal law treats electronic signatures as having the same legal force and effect as if they were signed on paper by hand. Therefore, online contracts have the same legal force as signing an equivalent paper contract in ink. Please note, to make any payments of your RentJuice bill online, you will be required to utilize an electronic signature.</p> 
	<p>Below is information regarding Records received, signed and/or delivered electronically by or with RentJuice. “Records” include, but are not limited to, applications, notices, disclosures, and authorizations.</p> 
	<p>By using the Web site located at http://app.rentjuice.com/ or any widgets and applications (collectively, the “Site”) you are providing consent to receive all Records that might be sent in connection with your online bill payments from RentJuice electronically, rather than in paper format.</p> 
	<p>If you wish to receive Records in paper format, you may send a request to:
	<br>RentJuice Corporation 
	<br>
	300 Brannan St
	<br>
	San Francisco, CA 94107</p>

	<h3>2. AUTODEBIT CONSENT</h3> 
	<p>The authorization to debit (singly or on a recurring basis) must: (a) be in writing that is signed or similarly authenticated (a click box will suffice assuming the customer has already established an account by selecting an authentication method such as a log-in and password); (b) be readily identifiable as an ACH debit authorization;</p> 
	<p>(c) clearly and conspicuously state its terms; and (d) must (for recurring payments only) provide the customer with a method to revoke the authorization by notifying RentJuice in the manner prescribed.</p> 
	<p>AUTOMATIC PAYMENT PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION FORM To complete your request for enrollment in the Automatic Payment program, please read the following carefully, indicate that you have read and accepted the agreement, then click on the Approve button to authorize and complete enrollment. To ensure proper withdrawal of your payment, please ensure you provided the proper routing and transit number from the bottom of your check on the Enroll Payment Account screen. The routing and transit number as well as the account number you provided on the Enroll Payment Account screen will be the account used to withdraw your monthly payment. Notice of the status of your enrollment in the Automatic Payment program will appear in the Billing &amp; Payment Notes section of your bill. Until your Automatic Payment is established, please continue to make payments on your account as you normally do. If, at any time, you wish to revoke this authorization and stop making automatic payments, you may do so by notifying RentJuice at legal@rentjuice.com. If such notice of revocation is not received by RentJuice at least three (3) days in advance of a scheduled withdrawal RentJuice may still debit your account for the next payment and your revocation will not take effect until the following payment.</p> 
	<p>Please enroll my account in the Automatic Payment Program. I understand that my payments will be deducted automatically from the designated account each month on my due date. I also understand that the amount of the payments may vary each month and that my monthly statement will be my only notice of the deducted Automatic Payment amount. Please print a copy of this agreement and keep it for your records.</p>
