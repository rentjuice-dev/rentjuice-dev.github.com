YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE RELIED ON NO WARRANTIES. THIS DISCLAIMER AND EXCLUSION WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES SET FORTH ABOVE FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”</p> 
	<h4>MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</h4> 
	<p><strong>Jurisdiction; Choice of Laws; Prevailing Party</strong>. The Credit Report Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of California, without resort to its conflict of law provisions. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to the Credit Report Terms will be filed only in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of the Credit Report Terms. The application of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act is expressly excluded. The prevailing party in any arbitration, legal or equitable action, shall be entitled to an award of its reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p> 
	<p><strong>Assignment</strong>. None of your rights or duties under the Credit Report Terms may be transferred, assigned or delegated (an “Assignment”) by you without our prior written consent, and any attempted transfer, assignment or delegation without such consent will be void and without effect. The dissolution, merger, consolidation, reorganization, sale or other transfer of assets, properties, or controlling interest of End User constitutes an Assignment of the Credit Report Terms for purposes hereof. We may freely transfer, assign or delegate our rights and duties under the Credit Report Terms. Subject to the foregoing, the Credit Report Terms will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective representatives, heirs, administrators, successors and permitted assigns.</p> 
	<p><strong>Severability</strong>. If any provision of the Credit Report Terms is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other provisions of the Credit Report Terms will nonetheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Report Terms is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify the Credit Report Terms so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled.</p> 
	<p><strong>Status</strong>. The parties will perform their obligations hereunder as independent contractors. Nothing contained in the Credit Report Terms shall be deemed to create any association, partnership, joint venture, or relationship of principal and agent or master and servant between the parties. The parties acknowledge that any and all rights not expressly granted pursuant to the Credit Report Terms are reserved to the respective party and that neither party will have any right, power or authority to obligate the other to any contract, term or condition.</p> 
	<p><strong>Waiver</strong>. Either party may at any time waive compliance by the other with any covenant or condition contained in the Credit Report Terms, but only by written instrument signed by the party waiving such compliance. No waiver of any provision of the Credit Report Terms shall be deemed to be, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other provision of the Credit Report Terms, nor shall such waiver constitute a waiver in any other instance.</p> 
	<p><strong>Publicity</strong>. Except as specifically permitted by RentJuice in writing, under no circumstances will you disclose to any third party, directly or indirectly, the terms and conditions of the Credit Report Terms.</p> 
	<p><strong>Subject Headings</strong>. The subject headings or captions of the paragraphs of the Credit Report Terms are included solely for purposes of convenience and reference and will not be deemed to explain, modify, limit, amplify or aid in the meaning, construction or interpretation of any of the provisions of the Credit Report Terms.</p>
