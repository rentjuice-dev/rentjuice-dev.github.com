	<p class="light">
	David sets the company’s strategy, recruits the world-class team of engineers and businesspeople who produce and market the RentJuice service, and monitors and responds to all customer feedback as we continue to improve our offering for the rental community. In this capacity, David relies heavily on his career experience in Internet technology and his rental property management DNA, having grown up managing several apartment buildings on Miami Beach. Prior to founding RentJuice, David evaluated consumer Internet investments on behalf of Mayfield Fund, a leading Silicon Valley venture capital firm. He was also a Management Associate at IDG Communications, the publishers behind 300 trade magazines and 400 web sites, reporting to the global CEO and VP of Interactive on new product development and business development projects.
