	<h2 class="condenced-bold">What's it like working at RentJuice?</h2>
	<p class="light">
	In short, it’s amazing. Recently, we were acquired by Zillow, the online real estate marketplace. While our office will always remain in San Francisco, we've now got the best of both worlds. A strong startup culture with the opportunity to contribute to growing one of real estate's most popular businesses. We're both growing fast and neither of us have plans to slow down anytime soon.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="light">
	Here at RentJuice HQ, we believe in an open work environment, where every idea is valued, everyone is encouraged to participate, and management is closely involved in building a close-knit and inspired community. At RentJuice, we are constantly trying to find ways to make work more fun. Whether it is playing tug-o-war with the office dog Summer, or participating in a company round of Fantasy Football, we understand the importance of creating a laid back work environment.</p>
