	<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
	<p><em>Last Updated: August 4, 2011</em></p>
	<p>This Privacy Policy describes how RentJuice Corporation ("We," "Us," or "Our") collects, uses and discloses personal information when you use the Web site located at www.rentjuice.com or any of our widgets or applications (collectively, the "Site").</p>
	<p>This Privacy Policy applies to personal information collected through the Site. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or credit card number), or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information.  Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed.  This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please email us at  <a href="mailto:privacy@rentjuice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy">privacy@rentjuice.com</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ON THE SITE AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h2>
	<h3>ACTIVE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h3>
	<p>Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit the Site or use any of the products or services offered via the Site. We collect certain information that you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, we may collect your name, email address, user name, telephone number, or credit card account number when you register, set up an account, fill out a form, request information or contact us by e-mail. We may also collect your social security number if an agent or agency requests a credit report concerning you.  However, we will store your social security number in our database for only as long as is reasonably necessary to obtain such credit report.  Once we request a credit report from our vendors, we promptly remove your social security number from our database.</p>
	<p>Personal information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection your participation in interactive areas on the Site, such as creating a profile, participating in forums or posting blog comments, photos or other content on the site.  From time to time we may collect personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.</p>
	<h3>PASSIVE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h3>
	<p>We may collect information that is sent to us automatically by your Web browser, such as your IP address, the address of the Web page you were visiting when you accessed the Site or an advertisement hosted by us on a third party Web site, information on your operating system and browser, and the date and time of your visit. The information we receive depends on the settings on your Web browser. . We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.</p>
	<p>Like many commercial Web sites, we use "cookies," and similar technologies to automatically collect certain information and manage the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web server. Cookies cannot be used to install computer programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Among other things, we use cookies to improve the Site and enhance your browsing experience.  If we link cookies to any personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personal information.</p>
	<p>You may delete our cookies as soon as you leave the Site. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions.  However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or functions on our Site, and you will only be able to log into your account and certain other portions of the Site if the cookies are enabled.</p>
	<p>We may use Web beacons or similar technologies on the Site and may permit third parties to place them on the Site. A Web beacon is a small, invisible graphic image that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity, such as to count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.

	<h2>WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
	<p>We will not share the personal information we collect from you through this Site with third parties, except as described in this Policy or on the Site.  For example, we may share personal information as follows:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>with vendors, consultants, and other service providers ("Service Providers") who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Site or the services we provide and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us, such as sharing credit card numbers with our credit payment processing vendor and social security numbers and basic contact information with our credit and background data technology providers;</li>
		<li>when we, in good faith, believe that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that disclosure is appropriate to: (a) comply with applicable law or a court order,  subpoena or other legal process or respond to lawful requests or legal authorities; (b) prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (c) enforce the Terms of Service of the Site or other agreements that govern your use of the Site and/or our services; (d) to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others,  including without limitation to protect us or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate, or unlawful use of our Site;; or (e) to protect your vital interests;</li>

		<li>in an aggregated or anonymized form that does not directly identify you;</li>
		<li>to enforce or apply this Policy, our Terms of Use, or our other policies or agreements; and</li>
		<li>in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, or in any other situation where personal information may be disclosed or transferred as part of our business assets.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Personal information submitted to the Site or otherwise collected by us will become part of our normal business records and may be transferred to another company that has acquired our stock or assets, for example, as a result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company’s use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.</p>
	<p>When personal information is shared with Service Providers, such Service Providers are prohibited from using such information for anything other than providing the specific services to us for which such information was provided.  However, we are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to any third parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing information directly to any such parties.</p>
	<p>You understand that when you join RentJuice, you will be added to the RentJuice Directory, which is available to all users and which may be made publicly available.  Such directory information may include certain personal information you provide to us, such as your name, email and other contact information, unless you opt out of including such information in your directory listing by editing your Company Profile settings within the  <a href="http://app.rentjuice.com/account/settings/company">Edit Directory Profile</a> tab on the Site.</p>
	<p>You further understand that when you use the Site, information or content that you post in any profiles, blogs, listings, public or private groups, forums and other interactive areas of the Site that are accessible to others, as well as any information you share with individuals through the Site or share through social network sites, will be available to such other users and in some cases may be publicly available.  We recommend you be cautious about giving out personal information to others or sharing personal information through the Site.</p>
	<p>Nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregated or anonymized information, which may be shared with third parties without your consent.</p>

	<h2>WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
	<p>You may "opt out" of receiving marketing or promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails.  You may also opt out of such marketing emails by emailing us at  <a href="mailto:privacy@rentjuice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy">privacy@rentjuice.com</a>, by writing us at the address below or, in some instances, by following the instructions on the Site.  If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or our ongoing business relations.</p>
	<p>You may also be given the opportunity to opt-in to our sharing your personal information with select companies that may make available to you products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. However, we will not share any of your personal information with such companies unless you have opted-in or as otherwise disclosed in this Policy.</p?

	<h2>TRANSFER OF DATA ABROAD</h2>
	<p>If you are visiting the Site from a country other than the country in which our Web servers are located (currently United States of America) the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting the Site and communicating electronically with us, you consent to the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy and you acknowledge that we may store and process personal information in the United States and other countries.</p>
	
	<h2>SECURITY</h2>
	<p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.  However, we have endeavored to put into place reasonable security measures in an effort to protect personal information while it is under our control.</p>
	<p>For example, when you log in, provide credit card numbers, complete credit reports, send information to us during the registration process or access your account information, we use a secure server with Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") encryption software that makes unauthorized access more difficult. In addition, your account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of the Site by any person using your password. Please advise us immediately if you believe your password has been misused. If you have any questions about our security practices, feel free to email us at  <a href="mailto:privacy@rentjuice.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy">privacy@rentjuice.com</a>.</p>

These links are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement of the activities of these third party Web sites nor any association with their operators.
